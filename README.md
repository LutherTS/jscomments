# comment-variables

A CLI tool for configuring, managing and maintaining JavaScript comments as JavaScript variables, via a `comments.config.js` file at the root of your project.

![Intro example of going back and forth between Comment Variables placeholders and actual comments using comment-variables's resolve and compress commands.](./assets/README/example.gif)

## Installation

```
npm install -g comment-variables
```

## Commands

**`comment-variables` (aliases `jscomments`/`comvar`) comes with four commands in this initial release:**

```
comment-variables
```

Interacts with your root `comments.config.js` file's default exported object to print all the parameters you need to be aware of before running `compress` or `resolve`. Also acts as a dry run validation check. If no error is printed, it means you can run `compress` or `resolve` safely, as long as the printed parameters correspond to what you've expected from your defined config. (Additionally creates a resolved version of your config data as a JSON file. If no configuration file is found, a tutorial mode is triggered, generating a template config file for you.)

```
comment-variables placeholders
```

Creates Comment Variables placeholders right next to the single sources of truth where Comment Variables are defined. (See in config example below.)

```
comment-variables compress
```

Scans your line and block comments for string values defined in your root `comments.config.js` file (like `"This is a comment"`) to turn them into their corresponding `$COMMENT#*` placeholders defined via your root `comments.config.js` file. (`This is a comment.` => `$COMMENT#COMMENT`)

```
comment-variables resolve
```

Scans your line and block comments for `$COMMENT#*` placeholders (like `$COMMENT#COMMENT`) to turn them into their corresponding string values defined in your root `comments.config.js` file. (`$COMMENT#COMMENT` => `This is a comment.`)

_The `compress` and `resolve` commands make each other entirely reversible._

## Flags

**The CLI tool comes with a single flag:**

```
comment-variables --config <your-config.js>
```

Passes a different file as your config file instead of the default root `comments.config.js` file (like `comment-variables --config your-config.js`), through a path relative to the root of your project.

_The --config flag can be composed with any of the commands:_

```
comment-variables --config your-config.js
comment-variables compress --config your-config.js
comment-variables resolve --config your-config.js
comment-variables placeholders --config your-config.js
```

## Settings

**The config object requires the following settings:**

```
data:
```

Your dedicated object defining your Comment Variables through nested key-value pairs of string literals.

```
ignores:
```

Your dedicated array defining your files and folders to be ignored by the `compress` and `resolve` commands through strings of paths relative to the root of your project.

## Options

**The config object supports the following options:**

```
lintConfigImports:
```

By default, `comment-variables` excludes your config file and all the (JavaScript/TypeScript) files it recursively imports. This config option cancels this mechanism, linting config imports. (The config file however still remains excluded from linting.)

```
myIgnoresOnly:
```

By default, `comment-variables` includes a preset list of ignored folders (`"node_modules"`, `".next"`, `".react-router"`...). This config option cancels this mechanism so that you can have full control over your ignored files and folders.

```
composedVariablesExclusives:
```

In due time, you may end up creating Comment Variables that are exclusively meant to be used to create other Comment Variables â€“ the latter classified as composed variables. By passing an array comprised of the keys of these original comment variables (for example, if a Comment Variable placeholder is `$COMMENT#COMMENT` its related key is `COMMENT`), this config option prevents these original comment variables from being affected by the `compress` and `resolve` commands.

## **`comments.config.js`**

A root `comments.config.js` file looks like this. (This is the config file I'm using to manage my JavaScript comments in this library.)

```js
const data = {

    }),
  }),
};

const ignores = ["README.md", "generate.template.js", "generate.example.js"];

const lintConfigImports = false; // can be omitted
const myIgnoresOnly = false; // can be omitted

const composedVariablesExclusives = []; // can be omitted

const config = {
  data,
  ignores,
  lintConfigImports,

export default config;
```

And yes, even comments within JavaScript and TypeScript blocks in Markdown files are addressed.
